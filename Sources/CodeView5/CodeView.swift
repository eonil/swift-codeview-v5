/// Rendering and interaction surface for code-text.
///
/// `CodeView` is buildt in simple REPL.
/// - Read: `typing` manages end-user's typing input with IME support.
/// - Eval: `state` is a full value-semantic state and modifier around it.
/// - Print: Drawing method renders current `state`.
///
/// Typing
/// ------
/// - This is pure input.
/// - Scans end-user intentions.
/// - Scanned result will be sent to `state` as messages.
/// - Typing is an independent actor.
///
/// State
/// -----
/// - This is fully value semantic. No shared mutable reference.
/// - This is referentially transparent. Same input produces same output. No global state.
/// - State is not an independent actor. Processing is done by simple function call.
/// - State is pure value & functions. There's no concept of event.
///
/// Rendering
/// ---------
/// - This is a pure output. Renders `source` to screen.
/// - You can consider rendering as a transformation of `state` to an opaque result value.
/// - That result you cannot access.
/// - In this case, `state` itself is the value to render.
/// - Renderering does not involve any an independent actor.
/// - Rendering is done by simple function call.
///
/// Design Choicese
/// ---------------
/// - Prefer value-semantic and pure-functions over independent actor.
/// - Prefer function call over message passing.
/// - Prefer forward message passing over backward message passing (event emission).
///
/// Synchronization
/// ---------------
/// Most control commands does not need synchronization
/// as they are designed as oneway streaming write commands
/// and ultimately can be performed on any state.
/// But some commands require bi-directional read/write,
/// therefore they need synchronization.
/// - Copy
/// - Cut
/// - Paste
/// - Undo
/// - Redo
/// Performing these commands with unsynchronized state can produce wrong result.
/// To support synchronization, we use "process-key"s. As each control command
/// This is especially important for your app's menu handling.
/// You also manage your app's menu to be called while this view is synchronized.
/// Use `isSynchronized` property to check whether this view is synchronized.
/// To prevent accidental such situation, this view crashes if you pass any control message
/// when unsynchronized.
